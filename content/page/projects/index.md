## Recent Projects
Recently I have been working on the following projects:
- [**ChuanhuGPT**](https://github.com/xingfanxia/ChuanhuChatGPT) A python webapp that enables users to interact with various kinds of LLMs from a single interface.
- [**MahjongDetection**](https://github.com/xingfanxia/mahjong_hand_detection) My first object detection project in a while, detect and recognize mahjong hands from a given image and calculate the score of the hand.
